	<b> I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for AI at the University of Bremen, where I work on making Web knowledge actionable for agent applications. I received my PhD (Dr.-Ing.) at the University of Bremen on March 19, 2024. From 2020 to 2024 I was a PhD student of the IAI group under supervision of Prof. Michael Beetz. My research focuses on creating actionable knowledge graphs, i.e. creating knowledge graphs from Web information and grounding the contained knowledge in the real world to make it actionable for users, and robots. Please check the links above and my github repos for more information on this.<br>

I joined the team of the Institute of Artificial Intelligence in 2017 as a research associate and to get a specialised Master degree in the area of AI. Previously, I received a degree as Master of Science in Management Information Systems at the University of South Florida, US where I specialised in statistics and data mining, after receiving my Bachelor of Science in Information Systems as well as a pre-diploma (Vordiplom) in business administration at the University of Osnabrueck, Germany. Before starting my academic career, I did an apprenticeship as qualified IT specialist, where I worked at Bankhaus Carl F. Plump, and IBM Germany.<br>

I'm also a mother of three and part of the women's representative collective of the computer science department (Frauenbeauftragtenkollektiv des FB3).<br>

My main research interests are
- Actionable Knowledge Representation (<a href="https://github.com/michaelakuempel/ActionableKnowledgeRepresentation">github for lecture material</a>)
- Task Parameterisation for flexible action execution on robots (<a href="https://food-ninja.github.io/WebKat-MealRobot/">github with website and code</a>)
- Web Information Extraction, Knowledge acquisition and processing
- Knowledge Representation using Knowledge Graphs, the Semantic Web, Linked Open Data and connecting it to the KnowRob knowledge processing framework
- AR applications. I am developing HoloLens and Smartphone applications in different environments to showcase the use of web-based knowledge sources (some demo repositories are in my github)
- Machine Learning and Data Mining <i>Nothing</i></i>.</b></font><br>
