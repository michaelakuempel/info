<h1> Projects</h1>

I am involved in different projects. I am happy to announce that my individual project called "Actionable Knowledge Representation for Robots" (AKR4R) just got accepted for funding and will start on March 1st, 2025!

<h2>AKR4R</h2>

The "Actionable Knowledge Representation for Robots" (AKR4R) project is based on the results of my PhD thesis and is expected to further advance the idea of actionable knowledge representation.

The project proposes a novel approach to enhance household robotics through actionable knowledge representation, enabling robots to reason about and perform a large amount of task variations with a large number ob objects. Leveraging web knowledge and the <a href="https://ease-crc.github.io/soma/">SOMA</a> ontology, it aims to develop knowledge graphs for robots to prepare meals, facilitating reasoning about tasks and their effects on body motions as well as objects and their influence on task execution. Challenges include automating knowledge graph creation, linking perception to action, and expanding actionable knowledge to new domains. Collaborations with leading institutions and educational efforts will disseminate findings and foster a research community. This interdisciplinary project combines robotics, AI, cognitive science, and knowledge engineering, aiming for sustainable advancements in robotics. The long-term vision is to create adaptive, intelligent robots capable of complex tasks, contributing to the field's future research and applications.

<h2>Other projects</h2>

  * <a href="https://food-ninja.github.io/WebKat-MealRobot/">WebKat-MealRobot</a> - our meal preparation repository where you can find all necessary tools and interfaces for cutting (and performing task variations of cutting) food with robots. Soon, there will also be repositories for pouring liquids, and other actions. So stay tuned.
  * <a href="https://michaelakuempel.github.io/ProductKG/">ProductKG</a> - my product knowledge graph with API to different ontologies for consumer and robot applications in retail environments
  * <a href="http://productkg.informatik.uni-bremen.de/">ProductKG Application page</a> - my product knowledge graph application page with different applications like a Sparklis webpage to query the knowledge graph and NutrOn, a nutritional support website for consumers

  * <a href="http://intel4coro.ai.uni-bremen.de/">IntEL4CoRo</a> BMBF project: Developing an integrated learning environment for cognitive robotics
  * <a href="https://knowledge4retail.org/">Knowledge 4 Retail</a> BMWi project: My focus in this project is the creation of Knowledge Graphs and their interfaces for retail applications
  * <a href="https://ease-crc.org">EASE</a> DFG CRC: My focus in this project is the connection of robots to Semantic Web sources like wikidata for household applications
